Part A: Questions 1 - 15 Explanations:

----------Question 1----------


----------Question 6----------
The function essentially takes 'byte', which is hex number 0x55, 
binary (01010101) and shifts it over 24 spaces, making 
01010101000000000000000000000000 and fills the 0's with 'byte' 
repeating three times. Making the final binary 4 concatinated 'bytes'.
Another int 'word' is created but is simply two 'bytes' 
concatinated and serves only to shorten the procedure in joining the
4 'byte' binary strings.
